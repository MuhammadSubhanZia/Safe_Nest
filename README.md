<h1>SafeNest – Women Safety App (Android) </h1>

Meet SafeNest a quiet protector when things don’t feel right.
This was possible all thanks to my wonderful team: Hashir Rauf Areeba Umair , Fatima Riaz , Safee Akmal , Mahnoor Rajput
Ever felt that gut-check moment like something’s off, but you can’t say for sure?
SafeNest is built exactly for that. A discreet, powerful safety app for women who want to be ready without raising alarm.
Here’s how it works:
👉 Emergency Mode can be triggered silently in the background just by pressing your phone’s power button 3–4 times in under a second.No screen opens. No sound. But the app starts working instantly.

Here’s what it does all in the background:
✅ Silent audio recording starts
✅ A realistic fake call appears on screen
✅ Subtle vibration feedback lets you know it’s active
✅ Sends your live location + custom SMS to your emergency contacts

💬 You can even practice with Simulation Mode no alerts, just familiarization.
🧩 Add or remove emergency contacts anytime.
📍Tap "I’m Safe" once it’s over and SafeNest wraps everything up quietly.

This isn’t about panic. It’s about preparation. Because knowing you have a plan changes everything.
How to get SafeNest? We will distribute a survey quiz, and if you solve it we will email you SafeNest APK file which will only work till 10th of July as this is just a beta version.
Because calm is power. And every woman deserves both.
